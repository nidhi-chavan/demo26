This is my demo file of git and github
dir
cd desktop
dir
mkdir demo2609(create a directory of name demo2609)
dir(check wether the directory id made or not)
create File1.txt file 
cd demo2609
(create a new repository by file name select readme option)
git init (initalize the git repository)
git status ( shows the status of file .If the file is stored then it shows the status in green if not it is shown in red below command is used)
git add .
git add . File name( To add the file indivually)
git commit -m "initial commit in file name file" (save the detail)
(To make the file global commands are as follows)
git config --global user.name "abc"
git congif --global user.email "abc@gmail.com"
(Now the file which is stored on local machine we have to store it globally on github by usinf following commands)
git remote add origin git file url
git commit -m"initial commit in file1.txt file"
git push origin master(it pushes main to masters which stores the file which is created locally is stored globally )
